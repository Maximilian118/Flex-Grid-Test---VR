      <h3>Ambitious Kickstarter project Feelreal intends to add Smell & Haptics to your headest. </h3>
      <p>
        Feelreal contains what the company calls a “scent generator” that holds replaceable cartridges with nine individual aroma capsules, generating scents such as burned rubber, gunpowder odor, lavender and mint.
        <br><br>"The unit also incorporates a few haptic devices including an ultrasonic ionizing system for water mist, micro-heaters for heat sensation, micro-coolers for wind, and haptic motors for vibration."

      <h3>Oculus Quest set for 2019 launch</h3>
      <p>
        Today the invitive headset popped up in FCC listings, indicating that the headest is on track for a Spring 2019 release. <br><br> The FCC is tasked with certifying products with electromagnetic emissions 
        to be safe and compatible with regulations. The FCC's public documents indicate the headest will support both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz WiFi. 5Ghz supporting a much higher bandwidth might be the key to a healthy resolution
        although matching the Rift's 1080-1200 per eye is still doubtful.

      <h3>Valve Promotes Latest Knuckles Controller from Prototype to Dev Kit</h3>
      <p>
        Having publicly shown off the Knuckles VR controllers for the first time all the way back in 2016, development of the device has seemed in the intervening time. That is until 2018 when the company became a 
        little less secret and began showing off more significant progress with the EV, EV2, and EV3 Knuckles prototypes.<br><br>This week Valve revealed the latest version, Knuckles ‘DV’, which company is now referring 
        to as a “dev kit” while calling the EV-series “prototypes.” Changes from EV3 to DV are largely refinements to the feel of the controller, along with tweaks which seem focused on bringing the fit and finish up to 
        consumer-ready levels.
