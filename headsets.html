        <h2>Oculus Rift</h2>
        <p>
          The Rift is without doubt the most popular VR headset to date. That's not to say it doesn't have any competition though with the HTC Vive nipping at its heals. Further inovation is an
          absolute must if Oculus wish to stay king of the hill. <br><br> The rift contains a luscious 1080x1200 per eye 90Hz Oled and is one of the most polished, premium headsets
          on the market today. For a 'true VR' 360 degree experiance the rift is one of the best options out there.

        <h2>HTC Vive</h2>
        <p>
          Similaraly to the Oculus rift, the HTC Vive has posesses a 1080x1200 per eye 80Hz PenTile Oled display. Contrastingly the vive uses a lighthouse system for motion tracking which 
          boasts a more acurate, bigger potential play area at the detrimant of a larger price tag.<br><br> The vive isn't without its critisisms however. The controllers are slated to be heavy and unnatural in
          the players hand, the content library is much to be desired and due to the extra £100+ over the rift sales aren't up to par with the competition.

        <h2>PlayStation VR</h2>
        <p>
          The third headset of the 'big three' is PlayStation VR. Sony's successful attempt to add VR functionality to its PlayStation console. At a significantly lesser price point 
          though the PSVR isn't without its drawbacks. <br><br> With a 960x1080 per eye resolution and a 100 degree FOV the headset feels like a slightly watered down version of the Rift or Vive.
          The headset does however include a colourful Oled display and even beats the Rift and Vive with a 120Hz refresh rate making movement feel more fluid.

        <h2>Oculus Go</h2>
        <p>
          The Oculus Go costs half as much as Rift and has a higher resolution screen at 1280x1400. You may be asking yourself 'in that case why don't I just get a go?'. Well it's sort of in the name.
          The go is made to be transportable which dumps the use of motion sensors.<br><br>No Oled display, no headphones and also with the absence of sensors, no spacial motion tracking. A perfect
          headset for consuming media but for gaming the Go will be lacking and won't feel like propper VR with no motion tracking.
