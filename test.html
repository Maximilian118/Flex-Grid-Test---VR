<h3>A comprehensive view of the Oculus Go</h3> 
<p>This review is an extensive and in-depth insight into the pros and cons of owning an Oculus Go over the alternatives. At a much lower price point than the Oculus Rift, the Go has a few 
drawbacks. No Oled display, no headphones and no space positioning. However, the resolution on the go is higher than the Rift giving a clearer, cleaner image. Perfect for media 
consumption.</p>

<h3>An in-detail talk about the Oculus Quest</h3> 
<p>After an explanation of the latest hardware Oculus intend on releasing Adam Savage Tested have a chat with Product Manager Sean Liu about the hardware inside the 
up and coming Oculus Quest. The Quest will receive a resolution upgrade to 1440-1600 whilst keeping the Oled colours Rift owners love as well as making sensors redundant with 
sensors built into the headset. Oh, and it's cordless!</p>

<h3>Chronos is a unique third-person experience</h3> 
<p>Created by Oculus, Chronos is another take on what can be achieved with VR technology. The game is a third-person, room-based RPG with stunning 3D visuals and well-designed combat mechanics. 
The concept is also original. As your character dies throughout the game he advances in age shuffling his abilities from melee combat to magic. Chronos is a therapeutic 
gaming experience that should not be missed!</p>
